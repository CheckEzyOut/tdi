# The above code does NOT make a connection or send any packets. Since UDP is a
# stateless protocol connect() merely makes a system call which figures out how
# to route the packets based on the address and what interface (and therefore IP
# address) it should bind to. addr() returns an array containing the family
# (AF_INET), local port, and local address (which is what we want) of the socket.
# This is a good alternative to `ifconfig`/`ipconfig` solutions because it
# doesnâ€™t spawn a shell and it works the same on all systems.
